 * Polymorphism
 * - Meaning Of Polymorphism [ It's A Latina Word Meaning Many Forms ]
 * - Describes A Pattern In OOP In Which Classes Have Different Functionality While Sharing A Common Interface
 * - The Beauty Of Polymorphism Is That The Code Working With The Different Classes Does Not Need To Know Which Class It Is Using Since They're All Used The Same Way
 * - A Real World Analogy For Polymorphism Is A Button. Everyone Knows How To Use A Button: You Simply Apply Pressure To It. What A Button "Dose", However, Depends On What It Is Connected To And Context In Which It Is Used
 *
 * Example In Real Life
 * * If Anybody Says CUT To These People
 * - The Surgeon
 * - The Hair Stylist
 * - The Actor
 * * What Will Happen ?
 * - The Surgeon Would Begin To Make An Incision
 * - The Hair Stylist Would Begin To Cut Someone's Hair
 * - The Actor Would Abruptly Stop Acting Out Of The Current Scene, Awaiting Directorial Guidance
 *
 * Explanation ?
 * - Make PHP More Easy To Use & Maintain Through Implementing & Depending On An Interface
 * - We Ensure That Our Classes Are Grouped Into A Sensible Structure And We Give All Of These Related Objects The Same Interface. That is, They All Have The Same Methods Available And Take The Same Arguments. Why Is This Important ? Because As Long As This Interface Is Implemented Then It Means That We Don't Need To Care About How These Classes Work, We Just Know How To Work With Them Because Of Said Interface.
